 ## Lab 1
 ``` 
1.Given an integer array, present three different logic to find MAXIMUM in an array (Do NOT use SORTING in any of the logic).
For each logic, count the number of comparisons incurred to return MAX

2.Given an integer array, present a logic to output an element which is neither maximum nor minimum. 
Here again, avoid sorting the entire array.

3.Given a number, write an algorithm to list all its prime factors.

4.Given two integers (m,n), present three different approaches to find GCD(m,n) and LCM(m,n). 
Can we use the Solution to Question 3 to answer this question. If so, make an attempt, let one of the logic use Q3.
